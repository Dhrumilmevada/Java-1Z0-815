--> Most powerful language
--> High Level Language
	- Human readable and understandable

--> 12 Buzzword for Java:-
	-> Simple
	-> platform independent
		- By writing program and compiling it on any platform, you can able to execute it any platform
		- need to convert byte code(.class) to machine level code, that is done by JVM
		- We have JVM for every platform
		- Just need to install platform specific JVM on target machine(Write Once Run Anywhere [WORA])
		- JVM is platform dependent
		- If you need to make some changed to compile source code on different platform than it called platform dependent.
	-> Architecture neutral
		- If any kind of upgrading related to os,processor or RAM was happened on target system, still java can run 
		  without any modification.
		- But you need to install JVM according to you upgraded hardware if required.
	-> Portable
		- you can migrate java program from one platform to other.
		- If the re-compilation of source code on other platform to crete platform specific binary then it is called as Portable. 
	-> Secure
		- To run java program JVM is responsible.
		- prior to execute java program, JVM will verify it for any security related issues.
	-> Object-oriented
		- Every things in java is object.
		- It has all feature of object-oriented language like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulations.
		- Multiple inheritance and operator overloading is not supported by Java.
	-> Multi-threaded
		- It support parallel execution of java program.
	-> Robust
		- it is strictly typed language.
		- Possibility of failing of java program is tend to zero once it is compiled.
		- With availability of garbage collections we never run out of memory.
		- It can also handle exception very well.  
	-> Distributed
		- Application can be distributed over multiple JVM on different machine.
	-> Compiled and Interpreted
		- Java is both compiled and Interpreted language.
		- Once program is compiled, then most of checks are done. So there is less check for interpreter at run time.
		- So program execution is fast and secure.
 	-> High performance
	 	- Java introduce JIT (Just In Time) compiler
		- When piece of code used for multiple type then JIT will not interpreter it multiple time but just once.
		- By this mechanism JVM performance get increase.
		- JVM with JIT compiler is called as "Hotspot compiler" 
	-> Dynamic
		- Java is dynamic cause it loads required functionality when it required.

--> Java can be distributed among the JVMs which required to send byte code from one machine to another which is called as Serialization.

--> Java technology includes set of library supported by Java language.

--> JDK vs JRE vs JVM:-
	- JDK will allowed you to developed java code, compile it and run it.
	- JDK is required by Java application developer.
	- JRE juts allowed you to run pre-compiled java source code. It will be setup in deployment machine.
	- JDK = JRE + development tool (i.e. compiler)
	- JRE = JVM + Java libraries
	- One can create own JRE using jlink in java 11.
